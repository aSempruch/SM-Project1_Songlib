# SM-Project1_Songlib
CS213 - Software Methodology Project 1 - Songlib

Design and implement an application with a graphical user interface to manage a library of songs.

## TODO
- ~~Write Names on Files~~
- FXML dynamic resizing (not super needed)

## Issues
- ~~When 2 songs remain, if you delete one, the details are not loaded for the last remaining song. They stay as the song that was just deleted~~
